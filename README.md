Credit classification is one of the popular classification problems encountered by financial institutions. For example, when customers applies for a loan, financial institutions such as banks would like to predict the probability of default. The data contains several attributes of persons who availed the credit.

In this project, we will do Exploratory data analysis and we will build classification model to see class probability.
